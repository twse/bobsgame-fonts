## NFTR Installation Instructions
The NFTR includes partial coverage of CP1252. The only characters missing in the NFTR is the non-breaking space, florin and small tilde. Use [Tinke](https://github.com/pleonex/tinke) to replace the font file.
1. Download the More English Training European ROM from ROM hosting sites (e.g. ROM Hustler or Emuparadise) and open it.
2. You see a file called **European_LC12.NFTR** in common/fonts/data.
3. Press **Change file** to replace the file.
4. Press **Save ROM** to save the ROM in a new name.
5. Test the font in the saved ROM using flash cards (e.g. TTDS) or in emulators (e.g. NO$GBA).

**Note:** The NFTR can only be applied to the European version. Applying this to the Japanese or Korean versions will make the game unbootable.
