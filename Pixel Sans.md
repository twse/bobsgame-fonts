### Font Replacement (PlayStation 3)
Use [Flash Font Replacer](http://ps3xploit.com/hfw/flash_font_replacer/flash_font_replacer.html) or Rebug Toolbox with FileZilla to change the font. **Pixel Sans** or **Pixel Sans Terminal** or **Pixel Sans Textbook** is named `SCE-PS3-RD-R-LATIN.TTF` and `SCE-PS3-RD-R-LATIN2.TTF` and **Pixel Sans Fallback** is named `SCE-PS3-NR-R-JPN.TTF` (Japanese) or `SCE-PS3-YG-R-KOR.TTF` (Korean).

**P.S.** The console stores its fonts in `data/font` or `dev_rebug/data/font` (FileZilla, if Rebug Toolbox is installed). The font can be changed in **Settings: Theme Settings: Font** (the game console language must not be Chinese or Korean). Using the system software with a version older than 4.81 or a non-PlayStation 3 browser (e.g. Firefox Desktop or WebPositive) will display a message and disable all features and using the tool under non-hybrid firmwares will show a message on loading.

### Font Linking (Windows and Wine)Use the registry editor (under Windows 10 and 11 the program is available as a shortcut under **Windows Administrative Tools**) to add **Pixel Sans**, **Pixel Sans Terminal** and **Pixel Sans Textbook** to `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\FontLink\SystemLink` with the value `Pixel Sans Fallback.ttf,Pixel Sans Fallback` and restart the computer.

### Font Linking (OS/2)
1. Use any OS/2 INI editor, e.g. INITOR or the built-in OS/2 registry editor (OS/2 WARP 4.52 Server for e-Business and above) to edit the system profile (`os2.ini`).
2. Go to `PM_SystemFonts`.
3. Add the `PM_AssociateFont` key and enter `Pixel Sans Fallback,12` as the data
4. Restart the computer for the changes to take effect.

### Setting Pixel Sans Fallback as default for Japanese and Korean in web browsers
1. Clone the repository or download the zipped archive or the font separately.
2. Enter text in Japanese or Korean or go to any site in these languages.
3. Open up the font settings in your web browser.
4. Select Pixel Sans Fallback as the default sans-serif font for Japanese and Korean. (This step only applies to most browsers like Internet Explorer, Firefox and other browsers.)
5. Use 8 points as the font size in Firefox (including forks) or any other browser. Other operating systems: use 10 points for Haiku or Linux and 12 points for OS/2.
